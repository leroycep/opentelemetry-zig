# opentelemetry-zig

This is a work-in-progress implementation of the Opentelemetry client specification for the Zig programming language.

# Status

Currently nothing works. I am working on getting the api and core datatypes defined first, and then will work on an
implementation of the SDK. This implementation will attempt to follow the
[Opentelemetry Client Design Principles](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/library-guidelines/)
where possible.

The first iteration will focus solely on functionality and from there, I may shift focus to performance.
